A simple GUI for the ``sphinx-build`` program
=============================================
Tutorial delivered at PyCon Ireland 2011

Requirements
------------
* Qt Designer
* PyQt4 including the development tools (for pyuic4)
* Python Sphinx

For Ubuntu and derivatives
...........................
Use Synaptic package manager or ``sudo apt-get install packagename``

* qt4-designer
* python-qt4 
* pyqt4-dev-tools
* python-sphinx

For Windows
...........
The PyQt4 package from Riverbank computing contains Qt Designer 
and the required scripts
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

You can use easy_install or pip to install python-sphinx

For Mac
.......
Sorry, I have no idea how you can get all these installed.
You wouldn't need to add anything to PATH I believe as they should be there
by default (/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin)

Files
-----
* dialog.py - main application
* dialog.ui - the dialog interface designed using Qt Designer (XML format)
* ui_dialog.py - Python code of dialog.ui generated using pyuic4

The ``docs`` directory contains an example sphinx project

The ``source`` directory is used as source in the dialog and ``build\html`` is
used for the output.
